# Image-Classification-Non-Neural-Network-Approach

Although neural networks are used extensively for image classification, this is an approach for binary classification of Images using Support Vector Machine.
The dataset used is 'horses or humans' - comprising color images of humans and horses.
It is observed how various data preprocessing techniques and choice kernels affect the performance of the SVM model.
The metrics used are accuracy and Area under ROC curve.
